	Long: `Fabric Operator CLI is a supplementary tool for interacting with Fabric Operator.

Itâ€™s not required for normal operation of Fabric Operator but provided as a tool for convenience.

It performs client-side validation and creates necessary resources in Kubernetes on the fly. 

By using CLI, it's possible to specify supplementary inputs as references to the local file system. 
For example if chaincode.folder is provided in the FabricNetwork CRD like below, CLI will create chaincode ConfigMaps before submitting the FabricNetwork to Kubernetes.

chaincode:
  folder: ../chaincode
